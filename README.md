# <h1 align="center">CometClaim üí´</h1>

<p align="center">
UTD's Lost and Found system needs a digital upgrade to improve convenience. Instead of relying on physical visits or phone calls, CometClaim is an online platform where students and staff can easily upload and browse a virtual inventory of lost items, retrieve misplaced belongings, and query a chatbot for any questions from the comfort of their home before making a trip to the Lost and Found office.

## Stretch Goals üöÄ

- In-app messaging feature
- Real-time call support for answering questions?
  - Connect me to a real person
  - Any other questions that the chatbot can use
- Anonymous Reporting
- Crowdsourcing
  - Allow students and staff to upload photos of lost items ANYWHERE on campus
- Map Integration
- Social Media Integration
- Location-based notification
 - When you mark a location on the map, if a new item is uploaded in that location, you get a notification

<br>

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions üöß üí°

- React Environment Setup
  - Pivot to other technologies such as Svelte or Nuxt
- Running to AWS Tech Stack Issues
  - If we are in the early stages, we would pivot to PERN/MERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node)
- Issues with AWS Kendra and AWS Lex (or AWS Polly)
  - Pivot to different technologies offering voice generation and AI Chat such as LangChain
- Either the Frontend or Backend team falling behind.
  - If this happens the best course would be to get some assistance from the other side until caught up

<br>

## Competition ü•ä

- UTD PD Lost and Found Inquiry
- UTD SU Lost and Found
- Social Media apps like (Reddit, Instagram, X)
